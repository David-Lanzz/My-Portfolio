                Olanrewaju is one of the brightest software developers I've ever
                met. I worked alongside him while building a two-player
                platformer, and in that time He proved his commitment and
                determination over and over again. Olanrewaju is always
                challenging himself--he's the type of person who reads
                documentation for fun, and his attention to detail is evident in
                all of the projects I've worked with him on. He's also genuinely
                a kind, encouraging person, and kept me from falling into bug
                blues multiple times. I can recommend him without reservation.

                a deeper understanding of everything he learns. He is meticulous
                in his work, ensuring that all tasks are completed to the
                highest standards. Olanrewaju's ability to work collaboratively

                helping hand to his colleagues and encourages others to do the
                same. His positive attitude and strong communication skills make
                him a pleasure to work with. In addition to his technical
